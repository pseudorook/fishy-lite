# zsh themes

Fork of the fishy theme found in oh-my-zsh, with much of the extraneous stuff
cut out. Loads much faster.

Also includes a battery gauge and git display that can be added to the right
prompt.

To install, clone this repo and source fishy.zsh in your zshrc.

To enable the battery gauge or git prompt, source battery-gauge.zsh and
git-prompt.zsh, respectively.
